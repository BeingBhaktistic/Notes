1. There is no charge flow between two plates of a parallel capacitor

2. Work done = Change in Kinetic Energy

3. When there is no external force on a system, then Linear Momentum is conserved

4. When there is no external torque on a system, then Angular Momentum is conserved

5. In an isolated system, the net charge is constant

6. In an isolated heat system, the internal energy is conserved

7. In a closed system, the moles are always conserved

8. Coulomb's law can be applied when two point charges are at rest

9. Electric field runs from higher potential to lower potential

10. Gauss law can be applied for symmetrical systems

11. Mirror analysis of resistance can be applied in symmetric cases

12. Calculus can be applied at variable conditions where small changes are noticeable

13. Avoid big integration whenever possible

14. Any vector can be superpositioned

15. We can use any coordinate systems and set of mutually perpendicular axis at anywhere

16. We can use vectors purely to solve questions involving too many vectors

17. Force = rate of change of momentum

18. When a group of particles are given use center of mass

19. When something is happening inside a system, two to three objects are moving here and there without the application of any external force, then evaluate centre of mass of that system

20. In rotating bodies, find a good Instantaneous Axis of Rotation to solve easily

21. Newton's Laws of Motion can be applied to a photo of the motion of the dyanmics

22. In Modern Physics questions, apply conservation of mass-energy equation, E = mc<sup>2</sup>

23. When there is no external force and no non-conservative force application on a system, then apply Conservation of Mechanical Energy

24. We can parallel shift the free vectors

25. Balance forces and torques in an FBD, if missing, add pseudo force!

26. Shape of conductor doesn't matter while moving in Magnetic Field

27. Use nodal analysis, KCL and KVL in electrical circuits

28. When short duration force or torque is applied, then use Impulse-Momentum theorem and it's angular analogue

29. Len'z law opposes you when you are generating EMF through changing flux

30. When a 3D photo is given, draw 2D from different angles

31. Always find constraints and fix your **pivot** in that substance which remains constant during the whole event of the situation given in the problem, such as: "The half angle of cone is constant, the length of the rod is constant, the length of string is always constant, etc"

32. For pure rolling, whenever two surfaces are in mutual contact with each other, the points of contact move with save velocity
