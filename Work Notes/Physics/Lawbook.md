1. There is no charge flow between two plates of a parallel capacitor

2. Work done = Change in Kinetic Energy

3. When there is no external force on a system, then Linear Momentum is conserved

4. When there is no external torque on a system, then Angular Momentum is conserved

5. In an isolated system, the net charge is constant

6. In an isolated heat system, the internal energy is conserved

7. In a closed system, the moles are always conserved

8. Coulomb's law can be applied when two point charges are at rest

9. Electric field runs from higher potential to lower potential

10. Gauss law can be applied for symmetrical systems

11. Mirror analysis of resistance can be applied in symmetric cases

12. Calculus can be applied at variable conditions where small changes are noticeable

13. Avoid big integration whenever possible

14. Any vector can be superpositioned

15. We can use any coordinate systems and set of mutually perpendicular axis at anywhere

16. We can use vectors purely to solve questions involving too many vectors

17. Force = rate of change of momentum

18. When a group of particles are given use center of mass

19. When something is happening inside a system, two to three objects are moving here and there without the application of any external force, then evaluate centre of mass of that system

20. In rotating bodies, find a good Instantaneous Axis of Rotation to solve easily
