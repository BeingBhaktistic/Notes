1. When you see something substitution can be applied, then apply it!

2. When you see something can be converted to more simpler form and more recognizable form, do it!!

3. If your mind says : "Accha hota agar.... ye hota!", then do it!! (Listen to your MIND only this time!!)

4. Always rearrange and remake the question to be **soothing to your eyes**, such as quadratic : ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0, Linear : ax+b=0

5. GOLDEN LAW : Make your eyes comfortable first! (aankho ko acchi lagni chahiyey!)

6. Reform the question to according to the pattern you already know before (ayse banado, purana koi pattern jyse dikhne lage!)

7. Use **RASA** - Relevant Algebraic Sense Advanced, means : writing **sinx** as **s**, **cosx** as **c**, etc

8. Substitute the hard hard complex substances to make it look simpler to tackle for the eyes!!

9. Remove radical powers as far as possible

10. Rationalize the terms wherever neccesary

11. Always draw diagrams to make the problem more visible to the eyes

12. Draw and visualize the problems in coordinate geometry, curves, area, definite, AOD, etc to for the eyes to solve the problem easily

13. Go with the FLOW of **FEEL** rather than **ROBOTIC** way of solution

14. Make your common senses and MIND more activated during PROBLEM SOLVING to make everything buttery-smooth

15. In vectors, complex, AOD, Conics, Definite Integrals, always draw diagrams to simplify the questions

16. Always impose low level simple patterns and deductions and scale them up to elevated problems, eg: when you see x and 1/x type, apply AM-GM inequality

17. Be fluid with the language and the notations used in PCM

18. There is Nothing like : **"OUT OF THE BOX THINKING"**, it's just an unbroken chain of deductive and logical thinking

19. Always try to extract 100% of information from each and every word in the question analytically, don't leave any word without analyzing why it has been given?

20. Do exactly what the question wants you to do!!

21. Always look for break-points or critical points, or something absurd noticeable things to be noticed, such as formation of 0/0 in a fraction, f(0), f(1), etc

22. Try to make the problem more relateable!!

23. Convert UNKNOWN situation into more known situation

24. Always be fixed in basic and fundamental rigid principles!!

25. Always DROP your **FEAR!!**

26. During problem solving, always each and every step with prior confirmation and consciously --- don't take any step without any conviction or don't take any step blindly
