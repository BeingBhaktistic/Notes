1. When you see something substitution can be applied, then apply it!

2. When you see something can be converted to more simpler form and more recognizable form, do it!!

3. If your mind says : "Accha hota agar....", then do it!! (Listen to your MIND only this time!!)

4. Always rearrange and remake the question to be **soothing to your eyes**, such as quadratic : ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0, Linear : ax+b=0

5. GOLDEN LAW : Make your eyes comfortable first! (aankho ko acchi lagni chahiyey!)

6. Reform the question to according to the pattern you already know before (ayse banado, purana koi pattern jyse dikhne lage!)

7. Use **RASA** - Relevant Algebraic Sense Advanced, means : writing **sinx** as **s**, **cosx** as **c**, etc

8. Substitute the hard hard complex substances to make it look simpler to tackle for the eyes!!

9. Remove radical powers as far as possible

10. Rationalize the terms wherever neccesary

11. Always draw diagrams to make the problem more visible to the eyes

12. Draw and visualize the problems in coordinate geometry, curves, area, definite, AOD, etc to for the eyes to solve the problem easily

13. Go with the FLOW of **FEEL** rather than **ROBOTIC** way of solution

14. Make your common senses and MIND more activated during PROBLEM SOLVING to make everything buttery-smooth
