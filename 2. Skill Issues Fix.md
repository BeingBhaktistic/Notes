# Fixing the skill issues

1. Stack Method - Stack the events one by one as it comes in your daily schedule

2. Fluidity - Be adaptable and fluid smooth with your day-to-day activities for hassle free, load free and be **chill!!!** with fluctuating schedule

3. Rearrangement - Rearrange your schedule according to the upcoming events and circumstances and be okay and chill with that!!

4. Tasks ❌;
   Hours Allocation ✅ :- Rather than alloting the day with tasks, allot certain time to different tasks accordingly. Don't see them as TASKS, see them as HOURS-Minutes-seconds, eg. 1 hour for work, 2 hours for japa, etc. Rather than saying "I'm gonna finish this today" ❌, say "I'm gonna give this 2 hours today!!" ✅

5. Be in **NOW** - Leave your thoughts and plannings in the software in God, be focused in the service!!   

6. Breaking down big tasks into **smaller tasks**

7. Be **CONSISTENT**

8. Four Pillars - **Chanting, Reading, Hearing, Working**. If these 4 pillars are maintained, then our day is successful ✅
